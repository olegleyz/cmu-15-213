# CMU 15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems

This repository contains my lab solutions for Carnegie Mellon University's 15-213 course (Introduction to Computer Systems).

## Background & Motivation

While diving deep into system design and exploring the architecture of various distributed services, I became particularly fascinated by the storage layers of systems like Kafka and S3. The elegance and complexity of how these systems manage data at scale sparked a genuine interest in understanding the foundational concepts that make such architectures possible.

This curiosity led me to realize that to truly appreciate and design robust storage systems, I needed to refresh and deepen my understanding of fundamental memory management and low-level system concepts. That's how I found myself working through CMU's renowned 15-213 course - bridging the gap between high-level distributed system design and the core computer systems principles that enable them.
